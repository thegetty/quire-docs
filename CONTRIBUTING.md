# Quire Contributor Guidelines

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quire!**

Striving toward becoming a fully open-source project, we encourage contributions from our community members. No matter what level of experience you have, we welcome all contributions, big and small.

There are [many ways to contribute](#identify-a-contribution-to-make) including fixing bugs, improving the documentation, and creating a new feature or theme.

The following guidelines focus on contributions to one of [our four code repositories](#quire-code-repositories) (including the repository for the Quire website and documentation). Please read through them carefully. Our goal is to make the process as effective and transparent as possible, and to ensure that your every contribution can become part of Quire. Thank you for taking the time.

There are even more ways of getting involved beyond contributing to our code and documentation repositories. They include participating in our forum, becoming a Quire ambassador, and attending or leading workshops, events, and training sessions. Visit the Join Us (https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/community/join-us/) section of the Quire website to learn more. 

🗣**CALLING ALL FIRST-TIMERS!** — We can’t stress enough that Quire is open to contributors at all levels. That could mean making a modest fix, like correcting a typo or fixing a broken link, or more intensive contributions like adding Quire CSS styles and JavaScript, or copyediting one of our documentation pages. Here are a few resources especially for you:

- Find the [“good first issues”](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tagged in our issue tracker

## Quire Code Repositories

There are four repositories hosted on GitHub that make up Quire, which is currently in closed beta. Please [sign-up for access](https://forms.gle/m1fgZu5BHKhddMrW7).

- [**quire-cli**](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire-cli): The command-line interface for Quire. Written in JavaScript, it is the heart of Quire, chaining together its various parts into unified commands.
- [**quire-starter-theme**](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire-starter-theme): The theme that is included when starting a new Quire project with the `quire new` command. It is designed to broadly cover a full range of use-cases and to demonstrate the range of Quire content model. The theme is where all the page templates and layout logic exist. Quire is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- [**quire-starter**](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire-starter): A starter content repository used as placeholder content when starting a new Quire project with the `quire new` command. It comes with some pre-defined example content and pages with which to get started.
- [**quire**](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire): The Quire website, and the central location for issues and discussion forum posts.

## Identify a Contribution to Make

**The first step to any contribution** is to post a new issue or comment on an existing issue [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/).

Find the existing relevant issue, or if it’s a new suggestion or bug, create an issue for it. In your comments, briefly describe your proposed solution and say whether you may need help with any aspect of it. This approach has several advantages:

- Lets people know you’re working on it
- Gives the core team and the community a chance to give feedback before you do any work
- Helps to ensure your contribution will be accepted and successfully merged in

All Quire issues should be posted to, and are tracked through, our [central Quire project repository](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire). Please refer there even if the issue is more specifically about one of Quire’s other repositories.

**The second step to any contribution**, once you’ve identified what you’d like to contribute, is to start work on it and prepare to submit. Read our [submission guide](#submit-your-contribution) below.

### Fix a Bug

Whether you’ve found a new bug and a way to fix it, or would like to help us to tackle bugs that have already been identified, thank you!

- [Post a new bug](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/new)
- [Find an existing bug to work on](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)

### Improve the Documentation

The Quire documentation is continuously being updated for clarity and completeness, but it’s not always easy to keep up with the pace of Quire’s development!

If there’s a section you think it missing or could be improved, we’d love for your help. And the documentation is itself a Quire site, so it should be familiar to work in.

- [Propose a new section or edit](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/new)
- [Find an existing issue](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquire-website)
- [Read the Quire Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/wiki/Quire-Documentation-Style-Guide)

### Translate the Documentation

The Quire community is global and we hope to be able to continue to expand access to Quire, including to non-English speakers. Though we haven’t yet done any translation work on any of the documentation or materials, if that’s something you’re interested in doing, we’d love to talk to you.

- [Volunteer to do some translation](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/new)

### Write an Article 

We’re always interested in adding articles about specific aspects of working in Quire to our Learn knowledge base. Maybe you have some tips on modifying shortcodes, or styling is CSS in the custom.css. Chances are the community would love to read about it.

- [Share your article idea](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/new)

*And if you need help getting your article converted from it’s current format into Markdown and onto the Quire website, we’re happy to guide you through that process.*

### Develop a New Feature or Theme

In Quire, themes contain all of a Quire publication’s key features in templates, shortcodes, styles and scripts. Themes can be complete packages of base styles and features, like [Quire’s starter theme](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire-starter-theme), or can be smaller packages of just one or more features to be layered on top of a base theme.

So, when creating a new feature of some kind, you’ll be looking to do so either within the Quire starter theme, or as a standalone theme, which other Quire users can add to their projects as they’d like.

If you’re interested in it being added to the core Quire starter theme, keep in mind some of the questions the core team and the community will be asking:

- Does this feature add something new that would be useful to a broad section of Quire’s user base?
- Does this feature positively effect Quire’s primary tenants of producing publications optimized for discoverability, longevity, beauty and accessibility?
- Does this feature integrate seamlessly in Quire’s current architecture and will it be reasonable to maintain?

Even if you plan on developing your custom theme/feature independently and offering it to the Quire community as an add on, we highly recommend posting about it on the Quire issue tracker. This lets people know what you’re working on, gives them a chance to offer to help, and can bring you valuable feedback and exposure for your work.

- [View the current roadmap](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/about/roadmap)
- [Read the Quire Technical Style Guide](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/wiki/Quire-Technical-Style-Guide)
- [Post your feature idea](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues/new)

Quire is very extensible and we’re eager to see more development work come from you as you create and customize your own publications in ways that can then be shared back. Quire is in the early stages of defining how this kind of contribution will work, please don’t hesitate to [email us](mailto:quire@getty.edu) with your questions or ideas.

## Submit Your Contribution

*We manage Quire through GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend starting with [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github) to learn by topic, and for a broad overview, [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/). We also encourage you to check out our article on [GitHub for Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/learn/github/). Coding Train’s video series is a great resource as well [Git and Github for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). GitHub can be accessed through the command line or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).*

Once you’ve identified your contribution on our GitHub [issues board](https://github.com/gettypubs/quire/issues) (either by submitting a new issue, or commenting on an existing one to claim it), you’ll next work on it and prepare to submit it to us as a pull request. A pull request says, “Hey, I did something useful for you, want to pull it in and merge it into your project?”

A pull request is a chance for Quire’s core team to evaluate
the proposed changes made and decide whether to:

- merge them in as is
- merge them in with changes
- reject them

To avoid changes being rejected, we recommend you post about proposed changes on our issues board before you start work (which gives the core team and the community the chance to give feedback and raise any concerns ahead of time), and also to submit the pull request while work is still in progress.

A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. We always recommend opening a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. As you make new commits to that branch and push them to GitHub, they’ll automatically be added to the open pull request.

This is something like what the development process may look like for you:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
  - Learn more about forks and clones in GitHub’s docs on [“Contributing and collaborating using GitHub Desktop”](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop),
  - Developers, please note that the `quire-starer-theme` is maintained as a submodule within `quire-starter` and they must be kept in synch. So, when submitting a pull request on the theme in particular, you may also need to submit a corresponding PR to the starter. Please make a note of this in the comments when submitting.
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
  - Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. We’re going to be writing Quire’s Style Guides to help with this, but in the meantime, please try to follow the patterns you see in the existing pages, for instance in naming classes, structuring page templates, and commenting your code for technical contributions, or in heading structure, tone, and tense for documentation contributions.
  - Test your changes by running `quire preview`. Depending on the changes you’ve made you may also need to run `quire pdf` and `quire epub` to confirm things worked there as well. You may need to check various mobile views as well, which you can do using responsive design mode in your browser. In general, your goal with testing is to make sure your changes don’t break Quire’s existing styles or functionality. Of course, the project’s core team will be doing this too and can help guide you if something’s not working as expected.
3. Submit a pull request through GitHub.
  - If this is your first time putting in a pull request on a project like this, we recommend the [*First Contributions* command line](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), or [GitHub Desktop]((https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial.md) tutorial. Or, Kent C. Dodds' video series [“How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub”](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
  - Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your pull request description (for example, “Closes #203.”)
  - Explain what the changes do, and what your approach was. If there were alternate ways of doing it, mention them and tell us why you didn’t choose them.
  - If this is a Work in Progress pull request, comment on where you are and what your next steps are.
  - Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request as needed.
4. Respond as needed to the review of your work by Quire’s core team.
  - Answer questions in the pull request comments.
  - Make changes and new commits if needed, or suggest alternate solutions if you have them.
5. See your work merged in to Quire! 🎉
