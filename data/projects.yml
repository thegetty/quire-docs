    note: "While their 2020 cohort of scholars didn’t have an in-person conference to attend, the Museum Computer Network (MCN) instead offered them the opportunity to contribute to a unique publication that would focus on the current state of museum technology and sustainability. With ten essays in hand, Quire offered MCN a free and relatively easy way of creating the book and getting it online. MCN also made the title available on Amazon in print and e-book through the Kindle Direct Publishing service (https://kdp.amazon.com). A grant from Kress supported the scholars, editing, and the modest cost of printing and shipping author copies of the book, as well as copies to recent MCN Board members and supporters."

    note: "Mia wished to publish a digital catalogue raisonne that 1) met the requirements of academic publishing (ie: stable, findable, citable) 2) provided a book-like structure and user experience (ie: bounded content, mostly linear structure, and straightforward navigability), and 3) could act as the digital front end for an archive whose data is housed in Mia's digital asset management systems. Quire supports all but the last of these. To create the catalogue section, Mia's developers mapped collections data from Mia's DAMS into Quire's objects.yaml file based on the object IDs of artworks referenced in the publication. While the data pull is automated, the connection is not “live;” a fresh data pull will coincide with the publication of subsequent editions of the catalogue, to be noted in the back matter."

    note: "The Akron Art Museum digitized Akron Art Mail: a mail art project from the community of Akron, Ohio, with the collaboration of the Akron-Summit County Public Library. This project was modified to be an image-heavy presentation, and much of the customization lay in resizing images and poetry to fit certain page dimensions. The museum chose Quire because it seemed like the best possible option for digitizing publications and preparing digital material for print. In a time of COVID-19 lockdown, Akron Art Mail made sharing art with the community possible. Quire extends the museum's reach and makes it possible for anyone with internet access to experience Akron Art Mail."

    note: "This project was created as the major assignment in a Museums and Technology course, in the Museum Studies program at the George Washington University. Using Quire exposes students to cutting edge thinking and technology powering digital publishing within the museum field, introduces them to the supportive team at the Getty, and gives them a beautiful final product in which to share their research and thinking from across the semester. The intent of the project includes offering students a deep engagement with a topic of personal or professional interest through a research project; experience in a collaborative creative environment through the peer review process; and practical skills in Markdown language. At the end of the semester, each student has a published piece to share with peers, colleagues and friends. To date, there is no better platform to achieve these goals than Quire."

The museum has wanted to try Quire and this seemed like the perfect project to get started. The catalogue was also translated and published [in Spanish]( https://publications.okeeffemuseum.org/halvorson/es/)."
