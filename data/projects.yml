    note: "While their 2020 cohort of scholars didn’t have an in-person conference to attend, the Museum Computer Network (MCN) instead offered them the opportunity to contribute to a unique publication that would focus on the current state of museum technology and sustainability. With ten essays in hand, Quire offered MCN a free and relatively easy way of creating the book and getting it online. MCN also made the title available on Amazon in print and e-book through the Kindle Direct Publishing service (https://kdp.amazon.com). A grant from Kress supported the scholars, editing, and the modest cost of printing and shipping author copies of the book, as well as copies to recent MCN Board members and supporters."

    note: "Mia wished to publish a digital catalogue raisonne that 1) met the requirements of academic publishing (ie: stable, findable, citable) 2) provided a book-like structure and user experience (ie: bounded content, mostly linear structure, and straightforward navigability), and 3) could act as the digital front end for an archive whose data is housed in Mia's digital asset management systems. Quire supports all but the last of these. To create the catalogue section, Mia's developers mapped collections data from Mia's DAMS into Quire's objects.yaml file based on the object IDs of artworks referenced in the publication. While the data pull is automated, the connection is not “live;” a fresh data pull will coincide with the publication of subsequent editions of the catalogue, to be noted in the back matter."

Using Quire exposes students to cutting edge thinking and technology powering digital publishing within the museum field, introduces them to the supportive team at the Getty, and gives them a beautiful final product in which to share their research and thinking from across the semester. The intent of the project includes offering students a deep engagement with a topic of personal or professional interest through a research project; experience in a collaborative creative environment through the peer review process; and practical skills in Markdown language. At the end of the semester, each student has a published piece to share with peers, colleagues and friends. To date, there is no better platform to achieve these goals than Quire."

    note: "*Perfectly Imperfect: Korean Buncheong Ceramics* is an online catalogue published in conjunction with an exhibition organized by the Denver Art Museum and the National Museum of Korea. While the catalogue was initially conceived as an in-gallery, take-away brochure created to accompany the exhibition, the move to Quire allowed the Denver Art Museum to provide more robust content, including 3-D images that enabled the viewers to experience a few objects more thoroughly. Using Quire also eliminated the cost and upkeep of printed brochures over a lengthy period."

    note: "Corning Museum of Glass evaluated several static site generator options for this project and found that Quire's focus on scholarly publications was a good fit for the structure and feature needs such as footnotes, a catalogue grid, and object entries. This particular project relies heavily on images and video, so the easy inclusion of IIIF 360º image players and zoomable images was helpful. The museum heavily customized the theme's styling, and added minor grid template customization to allow for direct links to catalog grid group headings."

The museum's web developer @daltonrooney  imported their Mingei Mono font, customized CSS affecting font sizes and colors, adjusted padding around images, redesigned the cover, and tweaked CSS headers on the essay templates.
