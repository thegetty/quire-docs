If the source files of your publication are hosted publicly on a site like GitHub, you should also include a `LICENSE.md` file to specifically define the terms of use for your files. A `LICENSE.md` file is not included by default in Quire projects, but we recommend looking at other Quire projects for samples. Typically the file will include license information for both the content and text content of your publication (Creative Commons), and also for the code (GNU Public, MIT, or others).
