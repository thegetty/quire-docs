Along with monographs, edited volumes, and serial publications, Quire is also designed with the publication of collection catalogues in mind. Collection catalogues typically feature a series of pages focused on individual objects. Each page includes images of an object, data about it, and an essay or analysis text. To publish this style of catalogue with Quire, you’ll capture object data, create the object pages, and then, optionally, display a visual grid of the objects.

{{< q-figure id="entry-example" >}}

## Creating an `objects.yaml` File

The first step of creating a collection catalogue in Quire is to capture all the data related to your various objects in an  `objects.yaml` file. Similar to how [*Figure Images*](/docs-v1/figure-images/) are managed with YAML, this data can then be pulled into your Markdown files through the use of an `id`. The primary way this information gets displayed is as a table of information that accompanies each object in the publication. This table is often referred to as a "tombstone". 

{{< q-figure id= "tombstone" >}}

There are two steps required when setting up your `objects.yaml` file. The first step is to create an  `object_display_order` list. This controls not only what information will appear in the tombstone, but also the order in which it appears.  

```yaml
object_display_order:
  - artist
  - title
  - year
  - dimensions
  - medium
  - location
```

Once you have determined the information you want to display, you then create an `object_list`. Similar to entries in a `figures.yaml` file, each entry in this list will reference a different object featured in your publication. The attributes that populate this list should include, but are not limited to, the attributes listed under `object_display_order`. For example, you may want categorize object types (painting, sculpture, drawing) for use in the [filterable object grid](#generate-object-grids) but don't require this information to show up in the object tombstone. In that case, you would leave `type` out of `object_display_order` but keep it in your `object_list`. 

```yaml
object_list:
  - id: cat-1
    artist:
    title:
    year:
    dimensions:
    medium:
    type:
    location:
    link: 
    figure:
      - id: 
  - id: cat-2
    artist:
    title: 
    year:
    dimensions:
    medium:
    type:
    location:
    link: 
    figure: 
      - id: 
```

The attributes you choose to include for your objects are completely up to you. However, there are some attribute names that are reserved for particular uses. They are `id`, `figure`, `link`, and `thumbnail`, as detailed below. 

| Reserved Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Used to reference objects listed in `objects.yaml` in individual Markdown pages. |
| `figure` | One or more images related to the object. The `id` values correspond with `ids` in your project’s `figures.yaml` file. |
| `link` | A URL to an external page with more/current information on the object, such as a link to an object page on a museum website.  |
| `thumbnail` |  A path to a smaller thumbnail image of the object to be displayed on a page with `layout: objects-page`. |

### Object `id`

The object `id` is used in the page YAML of a `.md` file to pull in information from the corresponding `objects.yaml` entry. The only time the `id` is not required is when the object information is listed directly in the page YAML as explained in [*Capture Object Data on Entry Page*](#capture-object-data-on-entry-page). 

{{< q-class "box tip" >}}
- The `id` can be anything as long as it starts with a letter, is all lowercase, and uses dashes instead of spaces.
{{< /q-class >}}

### Object Figure

To include one or more images on an object entry page, include a figure `id` in the `object_list` that corresponds with an entry in your `figures.yaml`. 

```yaml
object_list:
  - id: cat-1
    artist:
    title: 
    year:
    dimensions:
    medium:
    location:
    type:
    figure: 
      - id: fig-1-1
      - id: fig-1-2
      - id: fig-1-3
```

List multiple figure `id`s to associate more than one image with your object, as in the example above. This will result in a rotating carousel of images on the object entry page. You can also include videos, audio clips, or table figures. If any of the figures have a `label`, `caption` and/or `credit`, that information will be included as an overlay in the carousel.

### Object Link

If the `object_list` includes a `link` value, a “View in Collection” button is generated that links to an external URL. The text of this button can be customized with the `objectLinkText` attribute in your project’s `content/_data/config.yaml` file.

```yaml
entryPage:
  objectLinkText: View in Collection
  ```

### Thumbnail  

If you are using [Deep Zoom with IIIF](/docs-v1/zooming-images/) and the **first** figure listed in the `objects.yaml` entry (for example, `fig-1-1`) is set to `zoom: true` in the corresponding `figures.yaml` entry, Quire will automatically create a thumbnail image for use in an object grid. 

Otherwise, you can add your own small thumbnail image by using the `thumbnail` attribute and including a path to that image as the value.  The image should be small, approximately 300 pixels wide. When using the `thumbnail` attribute you must still include the figure `id`(s) in the `object_list`. 

```yaml
object_list:
  - id: cat-1
    artist:
    title:
    year:
    dimensions:
    medium:
    location:
    type:
    thumbnail: figures/lange-mother.jpg
    figure: 
      - id: fig-1-1
      - id: fig-1-2
      - id: fig-1-3
```

{{< q-class "box tip" >}}
- If you are using external IIIF images you will also need to add the thumbnail manually. Quire will not automatically generate a thumbnail for external IIIF images. 
{{< /q-class >}}

## Create Object Pages

Like all other pages in your publication, object pages are created as `.md` files in your `content` directory. To create an object entry page, add `layout: entry` and the `id` that corresponds with your `objects.yaml` file. Another option is to add the object data directly to the page YAML. If you choose to the latter, do this for all objects in your project and make sure the `object_list` of your `objects.yaml` file is empty.

**Object data that references `objects.yaml` file:**

```yaml
---
title:
layout: entry
order:
object:
  - id: cat-1
---
```

**Object data in page YAML:**

```yaml
---
title: 
layout: entry
order:
object:
  - artist:
    year:
    dimensions:
    medium:
    location:
    type:
    figure:
      - id:
---
```

There are two different ways you can format your object entry pages. Adding `presentation: side-by-side` to the page YAML will make the figure image and tombstone appear next to each other and `presentation: landscape` will make the image appear above the tombstone information. You can set a default format for all your entry pages in the `content/_data/config.yaml` by choosing either `true` or `false` for the `sideBySide` attribute.

{{< q-figure id="modern-entry-side" >}}

{{< q-figure id="modern-entry" >}}

{{< q-class "box tip" >}}
- `presentation: side-by-side` layouts will automatically switch to landscape mode on smaller screens.
{{< /q-class >}}

Whatever the presentation, you can further organize the content on the page by using Quire’s `{% accordion %}` shortcode to wrap the individual parts of the object entry into collapsible sections. Read more in the [*Accordions*](/docs-v1/accordions/) chapter of this guide.

{{< q-figure id="modern-entry-side-accordion" >}}

## Generate Object Grids

{{< q-class "box warning" >}}
- In order to access this feature in an older, preexisting project, it must be running on `quire-11ty@1.0.0-rc.16` or higher. Run the command `quire info --debug` to see what version of `quire-11ty` your project is using. If it is an older version, you will need to start a new project by running the command `quire new [project-name]`, or follow our instructions to [update your existing project](/docs-v1/install-uninstall/#update-an-existing-project). 
{{< /q-class >}}

In a collection catalogue, there is typically a visual table of contents that unifies all the catalogue entries. In Quire, we call this an object grid. The grid includes a thumbnail of each object accompanied by object data. Each item in the grid hyperlinks to the relevant object page in the catalogue when clicked. 

To create an object grid, there are three key steps. Add `layout: objects-page` to a designated `.md` file, add an `object_card` list to your `objects.yaml` file, and add an `object_filters` list to your `objects.yaml` file.

{{< q-class "box warning" >}}
- As of March 2024, if you use 360 images anywhere within an object entry (either as main image or within the body of the entry) the object grid feature will not work. This is a known bug and one we are working to fix as soon as possible.
{{< /q-class >}}

### Step 1: Add `layout: objects-page` to a Markdown file 

You can add `layout: objects-page` to the page YAML of any `.md` file, that file just needs to be located within a sub-section of your `content` folder. The `objects-page` layout will not work in the root directory. Learn more about sub-sections in the [*Page Types & Structure*](/docs-v1/pages/#create-sub-sections/) chapter of this documentation. 

```yaml
title:
order:
layout: objects-page
```

No other content needs to be added to this page, unless you want text to appear above the object grid.

### Step 2: Add an `object_card` list to your `objects.yaml` file

The object grid is comprised of "object cards". These cards are customizable and will typically include an image and select data about that object. An object card will be added to the object grid for any page that includes the `object` attribute within the page YAML. 

Add `object_card` to your `objects.yaml` file along with a list of the attributes from your `object_list` that you want to populate the card. The `object_card` list not only controls what information appears on the card, but also the order in which it appears.

An image will not automatically appear on the card. You must include the `thumbnail` attribute in the `object_card` list, regardless of whether you are using a `thumbnail` or a figure `id` that has the setting `zoom: true`. For more information about creating a `thumbnail` for a non-zooming images, see the [*Thumbnail*](#thumbnail) section above. 

```yaml
object_card:
  - thumbnail
  - artist
  - title
  - year
```

### Step 3: Add an `object_filters` list to your `objects.yaml` file

Quire includes the option to make your object grid filterable based on the object attributes of your choosing. Whether you want to take advantage of this feature or not, you must add `object_filters` field the `objects.yaml` file. 

If you **do not** want filters for your object grid, include the following line:

```yaml
object_filters: false
```

If you **do** want filters for your object grid, include a list of attributes that match options found in your `object_list`. It is ok to use attributes that do not appear on the object card or tombstone. Above the object grid, readers will be presented with drop-down menus based on the selected attributes that can be used to filter the object cards. 

```yaml
object_filters:
  - location
  - medium
  - year
  - type
```

## Advanced Options for Filtering Object Grids

There are some additional ways you can manage and organize your object data to improve the filtering experience on the object grid page. 

### Customize Filter Categories

You can customize the filterable categories by including `field` and `label` attributes with values that clarify the specific wording or desired appearance of your text. The `field` attribute should match the attribute in your `object_list` and the `label` is used to customized how this field appears in the drop down menu.  While `location`, `medium`, and `year` in the example below will automatically appear capitalized, a value used in the `label` field will not unless it is written out that way. 

```yaml
object_filters:
  - field: "artist" 
    label: "Name" 
  - location
  - medium
  - year
```

### Organize Filterable Data with `Sort`

Data for filters needs to be as refined and clean as possible, and it is important to be mindful of how your values are spelled or worded. For example, `year: 1993` and `year: circa 1993` will create two different filterable values. A solution for this particular issue would be to create a `sort_year` within your `object_list`. If you implement `sort_year` it must be applied to all object entries within the `object_list`.  

``` yaml
object_list:
  - id: 
    artist:
    title: 
    year: "circa 1993"
    sort_year: "1993"
    dimensions:
    medium:
    location:
    type:
    figure: 
      - id: 
  ```   

  ``` yaml
object_list:
  - id: 
    artist:
    title: 
    year: "1993"
    sort_year: "1993"
    dimensions:
    medium:
    location:
    type:
    figure: 
      - id: 
  ```   

Then, in the object filter, use the `field`/`label` attribute to ensure the data is being filtered by `sort_year` but displays as `year`. You can use this for other attributes such as `sort_location`, etc. If implementing `sort_year` then make sure not to also include `year` as a separate attribute in the `object_filters` list.

```yaml
object_filters:
  - field: "artist" 
    label: "Name" 
  - field: "sort_year" 
    label: "Year" 
  - location
  - medium
```
This also applies to capitalization. If the same value is capitalized in one object entry but not in another, it will appear as two separate filterable values. 

### Create Multiple Filter Values

Any object you are filtering can have multiple values and each would be filterable as long as the data is formatted in the `object_list` correctly. In the examples below, all three materials ("graphite", "pastel", and "paper") will be added to the Medium dropdown menu. Please note that the values will not be capitalized automatically. 

``` yaml
object_list:
  - id: 
    artist:
    title: 
    year: 
    sort_year: 
    dimensions:
    medium: ["Graphite", "Pastel", "Paper"]
    location:
    type:
    figure: 
      - id: 
```    
``` yaml
object_list:
  - id: 
    artist:
    title: 
    year: 
    sort_year: 
    dimensions:
    medium:
      - "Graphite"
      - "Pastel"
      - "Paper"
    location:
    type:
    figure: 
      - id: 
  ```
