Quire commands are typically run from Terminal on a Mac and Git Bash (or its equivalent) on a PC. They control creating, previewing, and outputting Quire projects. The following commands are available.

## Start and Preview Projects

`quire new project-name`
: Create a new Quire project named `project-name` in the current directory. The name can be anything, but shouldn’t contain spaces or special characters.

`quire preview`
: Run a local server to preview the project in a browser. Defaults to previewing at http://localhost:1313/, but will use other port numbers (such as http://localhost:6532/) if 1313 is busy. The specific address will be listed in your command-line terminal after running the command. If you’re having any issue with the preview, try running `quire preview --verbose` instead. This outputs error, warning, and other processing information that can sometimes be useful in troubleshooting.

`quire install`
: Install this project's theme dependencies when you update or change themes.

`quire stop`
: Stop the preview from running. This can also be done by typing Control-C.


## Output Files

`quire site`
: Build the final web files for your publication into its `site` directory. These include all the pages, images, and styles necessary for your project, and can be hosted on any web server.

`quire pdf`
: Generate a PDF version of your publication into its `static/downloads/` directory as `output.pdf`.

`quire epub`
: Generate an EPUB version of your publication into its `static/downloads/` directory as `output.epub`.

`quire mobi`
: Generate an MOBI (Kindle) version of your publication into its `static/downloads/` directory as `output.mobi`.

For the PDF, EPUB, and MOBI commands you can specify a new filename with the `--file` option.

```
quire pdf --file=photography
```

Outputs as: `static/downloads/photography.pdf`

Or you can specify a name and an alternative file path. If the directories don’t already exist in your project, Quire will create them and output the file there. We recommend always outputting somewhere into the `static` directory as this will automatically be included in your project when you run `quire site` to output the final web files.

```
quire epub --file=static/ebooks/photography
```

Outputs as: `static/ebooks/photography.epub`.

---

Also for the PDF, EPUB, and MOBI commands, developers may  use the `--env` option to specify and environmental variable.


## Customize File Templates

`quire template epub`
: Download the built-in template for customization of the cover and title pages of the EPUB and MOBI files Quire outputs. `epub/template.xhtml` All other template customization (for the website and pdf/print versions) is done in the `theme` directory.

## Get Help

`quire -V` `quire --version`
: Output the version number.

`quire -h` `quire --help`
: Output usage information.

`quire preview --verbose`
: Show verbose output in the command-line. Includes warnings, errors, and process information.

`quire debug`
: Development use only. Log info about current project.
