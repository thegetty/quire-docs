## About Quire 

Quire is an open-source publishing tool developed by Getty that is used to create long-lasting and discoverable publications. It is not a publishing service or a platform for hosting publications. Instead, Quire provides its users (students, researchers, professors, curators, editors, and more) with the ability to produce multimedia-rich scholarship for the web. The same set of files used to create the website can also be used to create a PDF, e-book, and print book. Quire is an excellent option for long-form book-like projects, especially those that rely on visual illustrations and scholarly elements like citations, bibliographies, and footnotes. Quire is freely available for anyone who wants to use it. You can learn more at <http://quire.getty.edu>.

## Before Getting Started

1. Install Quire: https://quire.getty.edu/docs-v1/install-uninstall/ 
2. Install Visual Studio Code, a free text-editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Part 1. Basic Concepts

In this section, you will learn about and get hands-on experience with the two main tools that are required to use Quire: the command-line interface (CLI), which is used to navigate your project and tell Quire what processes to run, and the text editor, which is the tool used to organize, write, and edit your project files.  

### Learning to Love the Command-Line Interface 

**What is the command-line interface?**

A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to run program tasks. It is operated through a {{< q-def "command-line shell" >}} which is referred to as "Terminal" on a Mac and "Powershell" on a PC. The CLI enables the user to type commands as strings of text into the shell. This is opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI), in which the user controls the program through visualized buttons, toggles, and menus. 

When you install Quire, what you are actually installing is the Quire CLI. 

This is what the command-line shell looks like when it is first opened on a Mac computer: ![command line shell](/img/screenshots/command-line-shell.jpg)

**What are the benefits of using the command-line interface?**

The main benefit of the CLI is efficiency. Instead of spending time finding and clicking on individual files, you can use the CLI to perform actions on several files with simple text commands. Additionally, CLI applications often consume fewer network resources compared to graphical applications. It's worth noting that the CLI is a powerful tool; however, it is used in a very basic, straightforward way when working on Quire projects, so don't be intimidated! 

**Navigating with the CLI**

One of the primary functions of the CLI is to easily navigate files on your computer. In the exercise below, you will use commands like `cd` ("change directory") and `ls` ("list") to explore your computer's home directory, the main storage folder that contains your personal files. You will then use Finder/Explorer to do the same thing. This demonstrates how running commands in the command-line shell mirrors the process of clicking through folders in your Finder/Explorer.

![commandline vs folder](/img/screenshots/commandline-vs-folder.jpg)

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

**Mac**: 

 1. Press Command-Spacebar to open Spotlight 
 2. Type "Terminal" (Mac's name for the command-line shell) and hit enter
 3. Type `ls`to list the contents of your computer's home directory
 4. Open your Finder
 5. Press Command+H (to open your "home directory") and compare the files in that folder with what you see listed in the Terminal

**PC**: 

 1. Open the Start menu 
 2. Select "Windows Powershell" (Windows' name for the command-line shell) and hit enter
 3. Type `~` and hit enter to ensure you are in User and not Administrator mode.
 4. Type `ls` in Powershell to list the contents of your computer's home directory
 5. Click File Explorer
 6. Click the PC icon (to open your "home directory") and compare the files in that folder with what you see listed in Powershell

**Go Deeper**: 

 1. Choose a file you want to navigate into
 2. Type `cd`, a space, and the name of the chosen folder and hit enter
 3. Continue exploring your computer's files
 4. Close your Terminal/Powershell when you are done 

 </div>

### Learning to Love the Text Editor

You can think of your text editor, like the free tool Visual Studio Code, as a supplement to Microsoft Word. A text editor is used to create, change, or edit plain-text files. The beauty of plain-text files is that they do not require proprietary software. Therefore, content is written in a way where, should certain technology go obsolete, your content will remain stable and accessible. The text editor is your primary interface for working on your Quire project, so getting comfortable with it is essential. It is especially important to familiarize yourself with Markdown, the format used for your project's more narrative/textual content. 

**What is Markdown?**

Markdown might seem strange initially, but it is a very approachable language that uses simple character combinations to indicate structure and add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs). Rather than using buttons to format the appearance of your text, as you would in Microsoft Word, you are using symbols instead. Quire then does the heavy lifting and converts those symbols into HTML for you. For example, something surrounded by asterisks in Markdown turns into italics in the final publication: `*emphasis*` = *emphasis*.

**What are the benefits of using Markdown?**

Markdown was designed for *readability* and is not heavily marked up with tags like other coding languages. 

A list written in HTML:

```HTML
<h2>An Unordered HTML List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>  
```

The same list written in Markdown: 

```Markdown
## An Unordered HTML List

- Coffee
- Tea
- Milk 
```

The fact that Markdown is a human-readable format makes it very easy to edit and it also helps preserve the longevity of your content.

## Part 2. Basic Concepts In Action

Now that you understand two of the most fundamental tools needed to use Quire, it's time to get a new project up and running and implement these basic concepts. 

### Use the CLI to Start and Preview a New Quire Project 

In addition to using the CLI to navigate Quire, as we explored earlier, it can also be used to tell Quire what to do, including creating a new project, previewing a project, or outputting a website, PDF, and e-book. In the steps below, we will use the CLI to create a new project, navigate into that project's folder, and preview it. 

*The command `quire new` generates a default starter project. It is a sample publication meant to serve as a jumping off point. It serves as a useful template with images and text that can be deleted or substituted when creating your own project.* 

![Quire Starter Project](/img/screenshots/quire-starter.jpg)

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself 

1. Open your Terminal or Powershell 
2. Type the command `quire new my-project` and hit enter. The process may take a few minutes. You will see the words "successfully installed" when the process is complete. 
3. Type `ls` to see the contents of your home directory again. This time you will notice a new folder called `my-project`
4. Type `cd my-project` in your Terminal/Powershell to navigate from your home directory into your new project
5. Type `ls` to browse the project files that were installed with the command `quire new`
6. When you are ready, make sure you are in the `my-project` folder and type `quire preview` to generate a preview website. Ignore the output in the Terminal/Powershell. Your project is ready to preview when you see <http://localhost:8080/>. 
7. Cut-and-paste the URL into your browser. Ta-da! Your new project is up-and-running! 

</div>

### Open Your Project with Visual Studio Code

Now that you have your new project up and running, it's time to edit it! First, we must open the project with our text editor and familiarize ourselves with the file structure.  

This is what the default starter project will look like when it is first opened in your Text Editor. ![Text Editor](/img/screenshots/text-editor.jpg)


<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself


1. Open Visual Studio Code 
2. Click File>Open Folder and then navigate to your home directory where you should see your `my-project` folder
3. Select the `my-project` folder and expand its contents
4. Find the `content` folder and click the Open button 
5. Go back to File and select Auto Save. This will come in handy later. 

</div>

### Navigating Files with Visual Studio Code 

The "content" folder is where pretty much all the action takes place. The most important files/folders within "content" are the following: 

| File/Folder | Purpose Served |
|---|---|
| Markdown files | Indicated by the `.md` suffix. This is where the vast majority of your content lives, with each file representing a different "page" in your publication | 
| `_data` folder | Contains YAML files. These are a plain-text way of capturing information that appears in multiple places throughout your publication like captions, chapter titles, object information, etc.|  
| `_assets` folder | Where a lot of the customization takes place. Includes things like fonts, images, and CSS/JavaScript files. | 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. Take a moment to explore the various folders and files that make up your Quire project
2. When ready, locate the `intro.md` file and open it

</div>

### Making Edits with Visual Studio Code 

Let's take a closer look at a Markdown file and make some simple edits based on what we learned in Part 1. 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself  

1. Make any changes you would like to the Markdown of the `intro.md` file. You can use this page of the Quire documentation as a reference: http://quire.getty.edu/docs-v1/fundamentals/#markdown-basics.
2. Navigate to your browser and preview the results 

</div>

## Part 3. Going Deeper: YAML  

In addition to Markdown, YAML is the other format in which you will save content in Quire. YAML plays many roles in your Quire project, including storing important publication information like title, subtitle, authors, chapter titles, captions, references, and more. 

### Learning to Love YAML 

**What is YAML?**

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". YAML's primary purpose is to save text/content as data. When it comes to YAML, it's all about how that information is formatted. It is always written as a data item followed by a colon, a space, and then the data item's value.

Here is an example: 

`title: "My Project"`

You can also use Markdown when storing information as YAML: 

`title: "*My Project*"`

*We advise always wrapping YAML values in quotations.*

**What are the benefits of using YAML?**

YAML provides a way of capturing information that appears in multiple places throughout your project and is therefore treated like data. This prevents you from needing to write things multiple times. YAML is also considered easier to read and write than other data-specific formats, like JSON, especially for non-developers. 

### Page YAML 

Every page of content in your Quire publication must start with a block of YAML. You can identify the YAML because it appears between a set of three dashes at the top of each `.md` file. The three YAML keys that must appear on every page are: `title`, `layout`, and `order`. 

```YAML
---
title:
layout:
order:
---
```

Let's look at the `intro.md` file as an example. This is the YAML block that appears at the top of that page:

```YAML
---
title: "Introduction"
subtitle: "A Tale of Two Photographers"
layout: splash
order: 10
image: figures/lange-house.jpg
---
```

The `title` is the title of the essay, the `layout` affects the format of the page, and `order` affects the page order of the publication. Let's rename the "Introduction". 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. Change the `title` of the `intro.md` file to anything you like 
2. Go to your browser, and notice that the title of the essay has changed
3. Navigate to the table of contents in your project and note how the title of the Introduction has changed there as well

</div>

### `publication.yaml`

Another role YAML plays in your project is storing important metadata. This information is kept in the `publication.yaml` file and includes things like publication title and contributors, copyright information, BISAC codes, publisher information, etc. The data in this file is automatically included in the underlying code of every page of your project's online edition, supporting Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and general discovery.

The `publication.yaml` file lives in the `_data` folder along with several other YAML files such as `figures.yaml`, `objects.yaml`, and `references.yaml`. We will look at those files a little later on. For now, our focus is just on the `publication.yaml` file. 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. Navigate to the `_data` folder
2. Open the `_data` folder and find the file called `publication.yaml`
3. Take some time looking at the content of this file

</div>

### `publication.yaml` Continued

As previously mentioned, YAML stores information that is used in multiple places throughout your project. The `publication.yaml` file is a good example of that. For example, the only place the title of your Quire project lives is in this file, but that title is used on the project's cover page, the sidebar menu, in the e-book and PDF version of your publication, and in metadata used for SEO and discovery. 

![The many places the project titles appears](/img/screenshots/quire-starter-metadata-change.jpg)

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself 

1. In the `publication.yaml` file, navigate to the `# Title & Description` section
2. Change the `title` and `subtitle` to whatever you want it to be
3. In your CLI, press Control-C to stop the preview
4. Type the command `quire preview` to restart the preview
5. Navigate to the cover page of your project and note that the title has changed
6. Open the sidebar menu and note that the title has changed there as well 

</div>

*When making changes to `.yaml` files it's necessary to stop and restart the preview for the change to become active/visible.*

## Part 4. Going Deeper: Images

Now that we have changed the title of your Quire project, let's also change the cover image. 

### Where images are stored 

The images that comprise your Quire project live in the `_assets` folder in a subfolder called `images`. 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself 

1. Navigate to the `_assets` folder
2. Select the `images` folder
3. Can you locate Dorothea Lange's famous photograph, "Migrant Mother"?

</div>

### Adding new images to your project 

Images can be easily added and subtracted from your Quire project. When adding new images they should be placed in the `_assets/images/` folder. Once the images have been saved, there are a few ways to add them to the pages of your Quire project. The first is by incluing `image:` and the title of your image file in the page YAML.  

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. Take some time to find an image that has a horizontal orientation
2. Save it to the `_assets/images/` folder (must be all lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces)
3. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the `index.md` file (this is the cover page for your project)
4. In the page YAML, find the `image:` field, delete `spiral-overlay.png`, and add the name of your image file in its place
5. Go to your browser and navigate to the cover page of your project. Note that in addition to the title changing, the cover image has changed too!

</div>

## Part 5. Going Deeper: Shortcodes 

The second way to include images in your Quire project is by using shortcodes. 

### Learning to Love Shortcodes

**What are shortcodes?**

A shortcode is a simple snippet of code inserted in a `.md` file that pulls in information from other files in your project. In Quire, shortcodes are used to insert figure images, citations, glossary terms, and more. 

**What are the benefits of using shortcodes?**

Shortcodes save a lot of time and energy. Rather than repeating lengthy information in multiple places throughout your project, you can use a shortcode as a shortcut. A shortcode usually references an `id`. For example, the shortcode below is referencing a figure image that has been assigned the id `fig-1`.

`{% figure 'fig-1' %}`

When you insert the shortcode `{% figure 'fig-1' %}` into a `.md` file, you will automatically the image that has been assigned the `id` `fig-1` appear when you preview that page in your browser. 

Here is an example of a shortcode being used in the `preface.md` to pull in a figure with the id `fig-1`:

![Example demonstrating how to insert and image with a shortcode](/img/screenshots/quire-starter-content-change-2.jpg)

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself 

1. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the `essay.md` file
2. Locate the shortcode that includes `fig-2`
3. Go to your browser and navigate to the essay "I. American Photographs"
4. Scroll to the part of the essay that corresponds with the location of the shortcode in the `.md` file. What do you see? 

</div>

### `figures.yaml`

The `id` is assigned in the `figures.yaml` file. In the `figures.yaml` file you store the path to the image file as well as the caption, credit, label, alt text, etc. Each image and its related data is assigned an `id`. As we mentioned before, the beauty of YAML is that you store information in one place and can reference it in multiple locations throughout your publication using the `id`. This also means that if you edit a image's caption, rather than changing it everywhere the image appears in your publication, you only need to update it in the `figures.yaml` file and it will automatically update everywhere the `id` is used in a shortcode. 

Here is an example of a `figures.yaml` entry:

- id: "fig-2"
  label: "Figure 2"
  src: figures/evans-sons.jpg
  caption: "Walker Evans. *Sons of the American Legion, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania*, 1935."
  credit: "The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles"

The `src` is the path for where the image is stored in the Quire project. In this case, the image `evans-sons.jpg` lives in a folder called `figures`. This is a subfolder inside the `images` folder. You can use subfolders to help organize your images; just be sure to include both the folder and subfolder name in the `src` path. 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the `_data` folder
2. Now locate the `figures.yaml` file
3. In the `figures.yaml` file, find the entry that corresponds with the `id: fig-2`
4. Make an edit to the `caption` for that entry
5. In your CLI, press Control-C to stop the preview
6. Type the command `quire preview` to restart the preview
7. Navigate back to your browser and note how the caption has been updated 

</div>

### Inserting the image 

Inserting a new image is a three-step process. First, save the image in the `_assets/images/` folder. Next, you must create an entry for that image in the `figures.yaml` file and assign the image an `id`. Finally, decide what `.md` and where within that file you want the image to appear. Then enter a shortcode that references the assigned `id`.

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself 


1. Find any image you want and save it in the `_assets/images/figures/` folder (the file name must be all lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces)
2. Go to the `figures.yaml` file and create a new entry. A new entry leads off with a dash. Make sure that all text indentations are aligned with the other entries or your will receive an error when you try to preview.
3. Create an `id` for that image (must be all lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces and also must start with a letter) and write whatever you want for the label, caption, and credit
4. The `src` will be `figures/` plus the image file name
5. Now go back to the `essay.md` file, and change the `id` in the shortcode `{% figure 'fig-2' 'is-pulled-right' %}` to the `id` you just created
6. In your CLI, press Control-C to stop the preview
7. Type the command `quire preview` to restart the preview
8. Navigate back to your browser. You should now see your new image, caption, credit, and label inserted in the text

</div>

## Part 6. Going Deeper: Customization 

There are several ways to customize your Quire project with varying degrees of difficulty. 

To make Quire approachable to everyone, regardless of technical experience, we’ve added built-in style variables that allow for relatively easy customizations.

### Learning to Love Style Variables

**What are style variables?**

Variables are essentially a list of built-in options for making style customziations. You can use them to control things like text and background colors, specific element sizes, fonts, paragraph indents, PDF margins, and more.

**What are the benefits of using style variables?**

While the style variables have a limited range of customizations you can make, they still give you a lot of flexibility when it comes to changing the look and feel of your project without needing to learn CSS/HTML or going deeper into the code and stylesheets.

### Editing Style Variables 

The style variables are located in the `_assets` folder, in a subfolder called `styles`. There, you will find a file called `variables.scss`. 

Variables are prefixed with a dollar sign and are descriptive of what they control. For instance, `$content-background-color` changes the background color of the main content area. The following variable would make the background color appear light grey: 

`$content-background-color: LightGrey;`

Here is a list of the variables defined in Quire and what they control: https://quire.getty.edu/docs-v1/variables/#defined-variables.

Here is an example of a customization (the addition of rosy pink at the top of the page) made to the default starter project using the style variables:

![Customizations to Cover Page](/img/screenshots/quire-starter-styles-change.jpg)

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. Navigate to `_assets/styles/variables.scss`
2. Make the following changes: 

    - Change `$accent-color` from `null` to `darkred`
    - Change the `$theme` from `modern` to `classic` 
    - Change `$navbar` from `normal` to `accent`

3. Navigate back to your project. What do you notice has changed? 

**Go Deeper**: 

1. Check out this list of potential color choices: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php
2. Continue to play around with the variables until you find a color combination that you like!

</div>

## Next Steps 

You can continue reinforcing the concepts above by creating a new page in your Quire project. 

<div class="try-it-yourself">

#### Try it Yourself

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a new `.md` file by right clicking the `content` folder and choosing "New File". The file name should be all lowercase with dashes instead of spaces and should end in `.md`.
2. Add page YAML block to the top of the page, including `title`, `layout`, and `order`.You cannot repeat an `order` number that has already been used in another `.md` file. Don't forget to include three dashes both above and below the YAML block. 
3. Add content below the YAML block written in Markdown
4. Add a new image to the project in the `_assets/images/figures` folder
5. Add a `figures.yaml` entry for that image. Start with a dash and make sure the indents are aligned with the entries above it. Include an `id`, `caption`, `credit`, `label`, and include the image path for the `src`.
6. Use the `{% figure %}` shortcode to insert that image into the `.md` file you just created by including the `id` you assigned it in the `figures.yaml` file
7. In your CLI, press Control-C to stop the preview
8. Type the command `quire preview` to restart the preview

</div>
