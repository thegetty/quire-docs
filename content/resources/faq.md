## Frequently Asked Questions

If you would like to add a question to this list, please post it on our [community forum](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/discussions). 

### Question: What are options for printing and distributing my Quire publication?

Since [Getty Publications](https://www.getty.edu/publications/) is a full publishing house, we already have production and distribution built in. We do short-run digital printing for  Quire books and publish in small quantities, between 100-400 units. This model has a higher price per unit but requires less upfront investment. The company we use for short-run digital printing is [Integrated Books International (IBI)](https://www.booksintl.com/), which supplies our distributor directly.
