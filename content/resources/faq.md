## Are there costs associated with Quire? 

Quire is open-source and, therefore, free to [install](/docs-v1/install-uninstall/) and use. There is no proprietary software or longterm maintenance fees associated with using the tool. However, depending on your needs there may be some additional costs. 

- You may want to hire a Digital Coordinator or Developer/Designer to assist with the publication. See below for more details on the kinds of services they provide. 
- While hosting websites like Netlify or GitHub pages start off as free, you may want to invest in an enterprise account especially if you plan on publishing multiple books. 

## Is my project right for Quire? 

Quire is optimized for book-like projects, especially those that rely on visual illustrations and/or scholarly apparatus like citations, bibliographies, and footnotes. Quire is also ideal for projects you want to last a long-time. While most websites have a lifespan of website is 2-5 years, the very first Quire publication, *Ancient Terracottas*, was released in 2016 and is still going strong. 

**Project types well-suited for Quire**: 

- Collection catalogues
- Conference proceedings/essay volumes
- Journals

**Project types not ideal for Quire**: 

- Non-textual, image-intensive presentations, like an online exhibition or a fully illustrated children’s book or graphic novel.
- Educational resources that require interactivity like annotations, collaboration, or open discussion.

We are always happy to recommend other tools that might be a better fit for your project like [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com/), [Manifold](https://manifoldapp.org/), [Issuu](https://issuu.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) to name a few. Feel free to email us at [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu) for guidance. 

## Do I need to know how to code to use Quire? 

While there is a learning curve to using Quire, the tool was designed to be used by technical and non-technical individuals alike. You will need to learn human-readable mark-up languages like Markdown and YAML but they are significantly less complicated than HTML and [our documentation](/docs-v1/fundamentals/) offers copious guidance. While Quire is heavily customizable and flexible for those with advanced coding skills, we offer an out-of-the-box option with pre-templated layouts that is accessible for all. 

We recommend taking our [hands-on workshop](/resource/workshop/) to get a sense of whether Quire is the right fit for you!

## What is the difference between v0 and v1?

When Quire was first launched in 2016 we used the static-site generator Hugo. However, when we decided to open-source the tool in 2022 we switched to Eleventy as our static-site generator since it was based on JavaScript and that is a more common code language in the cultural heritage sector. Publications built with v0 will continue to work and are not deprecated, however,  they may be more difficult to update over time. For new users, we recommend using v1 as it is the most stable, reliable, and fully featured version of the tool. 

For more information on what changed between the two versions, please see our [Key Changes in Version](/docs-v1/key-changes/) 1 page. 

## What are the technology requirements for Quire?

See our [Implementation Considerations](docs-v1/implementation/) page for more information on the technology stack and operating system compatibility for Quire.
