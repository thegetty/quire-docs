For over sixty years, [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/) has celebrated the world's artistic legacy through the publication of award-winning books and journals. Over the last two decades, the internet has become a vital platform for creating and disseminating critical scholarship online. Yet, the field of digital publishing still lacks reliable, affordable, and sustainable tools for presenting visually rich narratives that are globally accessible across devices and borders. Getty is uniquely positioned to build on its expertise in the field and advance this effort. Keep reading to learn how Quire evolved as the cornerstone of the institution's pioneering [digital publishing work](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/index.html).

## 2012

Getty Publications experiments with a number of different digital formats, including EPUB and MOBI e-books, a mobile app, an online collection catalogue, and two titles created in Apple’s iBooks Author tool ([*Visions of Tondal*](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-visions-of-tondal/id567895177) and [*Looking East*](https://books.apple.com/us/book/looking-east/id605969649)).

## 2016

Getty publishes its first multiformat collection catalogue, [*Ancient Terracottas*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/terracottas/). The publication is made available online and in e-book and print editions.

Also released this year are [*Roman Mosaics*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/romanmosaics/) and the third edition of [*Introduction to Metadata*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/). [ARLIS/NA's *Multimedia & Technology Reviews*](https://arlisna.org/publications/multimedia-technology-reviews/1025-roman-mosaics-in-the-j-paul-getty-museum) writes that *Roman Mosaics* has a "dynamic design that encourages further discovery and scholarship."

Getty Publications editor, Ruth Evans Lane, writes an article, [“An Editor's View of Digital Publishing,”](http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/an-editors-view-of-digital-publishing/) for Getty's blog, *The Iris*, detailing her experience working on *Ancient Terracottas* and *Roman Mosaics*.

## 2017

OSCI concludes. While the program transformed the digital publishing landscape for museums [notable challenges remained](https://www.getty.edu/publications/osci-report//remaining-challenges/), particularly around the discoverability, longevity, and objectness of digital catalogues. (Read the full [*OSCI Final Report*](https://www.getty.edu/publications/osci-report//).)
