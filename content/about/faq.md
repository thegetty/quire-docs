**Why is it called Quire**

From *Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms (Getty Publications)*:
> *Quires are the “gatherings” or “booklets” of which a book is formed. Quire numeration, which began in the Late Antique period, consists of numbers written on a quire (usually on its final verso) to facilitate arrangement during binding. Quire signatures (or leaf signatures) are numbers and/or letters written in a quire to facilitate the arrangement of its internal components. These were at first ad hoc, but beginning around 1400 they might follow a system: for example, ai-aiv could be written on the first four leaves of the first quire; bi-biv on the first four leaves of the second quire, and so on. Such annotations only became widespread from the late thirteenth century on.*

From Google:
> *quire: 1. four sheets of paper or parchment folded to form eight leaves, as in medieval manuscripts. 2. any collection of leaves one within another in a manuscript or book. 3. 25 (formerly 24) sheets of paper; one-twentieth of a ream.*

In Latin:
> *Quire is also a form of the Latin verb “queo”, or “I am able” or “I can”. Specifically, it’s the 2nd principal part and so means “to be able”. It’s also intransitive and expects an action. To be able to write, “quire scribere”. To be able to publish, “quire prodere”. To be able to edit, “quire corrigere”. Quire literally “can” do anything.*
